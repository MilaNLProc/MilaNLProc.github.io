These approaches, however, exploit general dialogic corpora (e.g., Reddit) and thus presumably fail to reliably embed domain-specific knowledge useful for concrete downstream TOD domains. In this work, we investigate the effects of domain specialization of pretrained language models (PLMs) for task-oriented dialog. Within our DS-TOD framework, we first automatically extract salient domain-specific terms, and then use them to construct DomainCC and DomainReddit -- resources that we leverage for domain-specific pretraining, based on (i) masked language modeling (MLM) and (ii) response selection (RS) objectives, respectively. We further propose a resource-efficient and modular domain specialization by means of domain adapters -- additional parameter-light layers in which we encode the domain knowledge. Our experiments with two prominent TOD tasks -- dialog state tracking (DST) and response retrieval (RR) -- encompassing five domains from the MultiWOZ TOD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our domain specialization approach. Moreover, we show that the light-weight adapter-based specialization (1) performs comparably to full fine-tuning in single-domain setups and (2) is particularly suitable for multi-domain specialization, in which, besides advantageous computational footprint, it can offer better downstream performance.

We employ our resource to assess the effect of argumentative fine-tuning and debiasing on the intrinsic bias found in transformer-based language models using a lightweight adapter-based approach that is more sustainable and parameter-efficient than full fine-tuning. Finally, we analyze the potential impact of language model debiasing on the performance in argument quality prediction, a downstream task of computational argumentation.

E.g., neural hate speech detection models are strongly influenced by identity terms like gay, or women, resulting in false positives, severe unintended bias, and lower performance. Most mitigation techniques use lists of identity terms or samples from the target domain during training. However, this approach requires a-priori knowledge and introduces further bias if important terms are neglected. Instead, we propose a knowledge-free Entropy-based Attention Regularization (EAR) to discourage overfitting to training-specific terms. An additional objective function penalizes tokens with low self-attention entropy. We fine-tune BERT via EAR: the resulting model matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance for hate speech classification and bias metrics on three benchmark corpora in English and Italian. EAR also reveals overfitting terms, i.e., terms most likely to induce bias, to help identify their effect on the model, task, and predictions.","tags":["Hate Speech","Bias","Entropy","Attention","Regularization","NLP"],"title":"Entropy-based Attention Regularization Frees Unintended Bias Mitigation from Lists","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Bianchi","Debora Nozza","Dirk Hovy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632700800,"objectID":"b1c2faca5f564af0d8c61cdc3932b12b","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2021-language-invariant-properties-nlp/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T14:48:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-language-invariant-properties-nlp/","section":"publication","summary":"Meaning is context-dependent, but many properties of language (should) remain the same even if we transform the context.

Since pledges might vary by election year and party, we implement a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) setup, predicting election year and manifesto's party as auxiliary tasks. Pledges can also span several sentences, so we use hierarchical models that incorporate contextual information. Lastly, we evaluate the models in a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) framework across countries and languages.

With rapidly developing (neural) models and ever-more available data, current NLP models have access to more information than any human speaker during their life. Still, it would be hard to argue that NLP models have reached human-level capacity. In this position paper, we argue that the reason for the current limitations is a focus on information content while ignoring language's social factors. We show that current NLP systems systematically break down when faced with interpreting the social factors of language. This limits applications to a subset of information-related tasks and prevents NLP from reaching human-level performance.

In particular, Devlin et al.

The authors also released multilingual BERT (mBERT), a model trained on a corpus of 104 languages, which can serve as a universal language model. This model obtained impressive results on a zero-shot cross-lingual natural inference task. Driven by the potential of BERT models, the NLP community has started to investigate and generate an abundant number of BERT models that are trained on a particular language, and tested on a specific data domain and task. This allows us to evaluate the true potential of mBERT as a universal language model, by comparing it to the performance of these more specific models. This paper presents the current state of the art in language-specific BERT models, providing an overall picture with respect to different dimensions (i.e. architectures, data domains, and tasks).

For democracy to function effectively, political parties must offer clear choices to voters during election campaigns. However, as parties’ communication with voters has become increasingly fragmented and targeted, it is much harder for citizens to keep track of what parties are promising. This threatens the quality of democratic representation. It also challenges established research methods for studying parties’ campaign promises.

The project will integrate existing qualitative methods in political science and develop new research tools based on NLP. These AI-powered tools will enable researchers to examine parties’ campaign promises in large amounts of text and speech. The resulting research will be of significant benefit to citizens, who will receive greater clarity on the choices that parties are offering. These existing and new methods are highly relevant to research on text and speech in a wide range of social science fields. Until now, progress in this field has been stifled by limited dialogue among the proponents of different qualitative and quantitative methods.

This interdisciplinary, multi-institutional project (led by George Washington University) helps Twitter tackle these issues by developing metrics and algorithms to measure various uncivil behaviors. Given the concerns about growing polarization and the spread of misinformation, our first two metrics, mutual recognition and diversity of perspectives, will help Twitter diagnose issues that arise when users isolate themselves from those who hold differing opinions. Mutual recognition measures whether and to what extent people on opposing sides of an issue acknowledge and engage with rival claims. When recognition occurs, a public sphere is established. When there is no recognition, echo chambers result. Diversity of perspectives measures the range of claims made on the platform, how likely users are to encounter (as opposed to engaging with) divergent and unfamiliar claims, and how polarized the debate is.\nOur second two metrics, incivility, and intolerance, will help Twitter identify and address abuse and targeted harassment. Incivility measures the presence of anti-normative intensity in conversation, including the use of profanity and vulgarity. However, recognizing that such anti-normative communication sometimes serves justifiable\u0026ndash;and in some cases, even beneficial\u0026ndash;ends, we distinguish this concept from intolerance. Targeted attacks on individuals or groups, particularly when carried out based on gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, or ability, threaten the fundamental democratic principles of equality and freedom.\nTo classify these measures at scale, we draw upon existing work in various computational fields, notably natural language processing and network analysis, but take this work further in addressing the metrics outlined here. Moreover, beyond merely detecting and measuring mutual recognition, diversity of perspectives, incivility, and intolerance, we propose to study the effects these four phenomena have on users.

Collecting corpora for the task is difficult, because normally it is not possible to know whether reviews are genuine. A common workaround involves collecting (supposedly) truthful reviews online and adding them to a set of deceptive reviews obtained through crowdsourcing services. Models trained this way are generally successful at discriminating between ‘genuine’ online reviews and the crowdsourced deceptive reviews. It has been argued that the deceptive reviews obtained via crowdsourcing are very different from real fake reviews, but the claim has never been properly tested. In this paper, we compare (false) crowdsourced reviews with a set of ‘real’ fake reviews published on line. We evaluate their degree of similarity and their usefulness in training models for the detection of untrustworthy reviews. We find that the deceptive reviews collected via crowdsourcing are significantly different from the fake reviews published online.

While effective, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, since networks are usually represented as sparse adjacency matrices of connections, which grow exponentially with the number of users. In order to incorporate this information, we therefore need to limit the network size, in turn limiting performance and risking sample bias. In this paper, we address these limitations by instead using dense network representations. We explore two methods to learn continuous node representations from either 1) the network structure with node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016), or 2) textual user mentions via doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014). We combine both methods with input from social media posts in an attention-based convolutional neural network and evaluate the contribution of each component on geolocation performance. Our method enables us to incorporate arbitrarily large networks in a fixed-length vector, without limiting the network size. Our models achieve competitive results with similar state-of-the-art methods, but with much fewer model parameters, while being applicable to networks of virtually any size.

Typically, the problem is modeled as either multi-class classification or regression. In the first case, the classes are geographic areas previously identified; in the second, the models directly predict geographic coordinates. The former requires discretization of the coordinates, but yields better performance. The latter is potentially more precise and true to the nature of the problem, but often results in worse performance. We propose to combine the two approaches in an attention-based multitask convolutional neural network that jointly predicts both discrete locations and continuous geographic coordinates. We evaluate the multi-task (MTL) model against single-task models and prior work. We find that MTL significantly improves performance, reporting large gains on one data set, but also note that the correlation between labels and coordinates has a marked impact on the effectiveness of including a regression task.","tags":["geolocation","multitask learning","NLP"],"title":"Geolocation with Attention-Based Multitask Learning Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanh Nguyen","Dirk Hovy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572739200,"objectID":"da268d55d2d3daa3188db963df72f794","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2019_siri/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T01:35:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_siri/","section":"publication","summary":"User reviews provide a significant source of information for companies to understand their market and audience.

Our paper examines this issue by analyzing user reviews from the Best Buy US website for smart speakers. Using coherence scores to choose topics, we test whether the results help us to understand user interests and concerns. We find that while coherence scores are a good starting point to identify a number of topics, it still requires manual adaptation based on domain knowledge to provide market insights.

However, locations are usually given as continuous latitude/longitude tuples, so we first need to define discrete geographic regions that can serve as labels. Most studies use some form of clustering to discretize the continuous coordinates (Han et al., 2016). However, the resulting regions do not always correspond to existing linguistic areas. Consequently, accuracy at 100 miles tends to be good, but degrades for finer-grained distinctions, when different linguistic regions get lumped together. We describe a new algorithm, Point-to-City (P2C), an iterative k-d tree-based method for clustering geographic coordinates and associating them with towns. We create three sets of labels at different levels of granularity, and compare performance of a state-of-the-art geolocation model trained and tested with P2C labels to one with regular k-d tree labels. Even though P2C results in substantially more labels than the baseline, model accuracy increases significantly over using traditional labels at the fine-grained level, while staying comparable at 100 miles. The results suggest that identifying meaningful linguistic areas is crucial for improving geolocation at a fine-grained level.","tags":["geolocation","NLP","clustering"],"title":"Identifying Linguistic Areas for Geolocation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aparna Garimella","Carmen Banea","Dirk Hovy","Rada Mihalcea"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562112000,"objectID":"5dec16fd019afc36d15e76cab7ab6ea4","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2019-gender-bias-part-of-speech-tagging-dependency-parsing/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T01:35:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-gender-bias-part-of-speech-tagging-dependency-parsing/","section":"publication","summary":"Several linguistic studies have shown the prevalence of various lexical and grammatical patterns in texts authored by a person of a particular gender, but models for part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing have still not adapted to account for these differences.

In most languages, dialects exist along a continuum, and are commonly discretized by combining the extent of several preselected linguistic variables. However, the selection of these variables is theory-driven and itself insensitive to change. We use Doc2Vec on a corpus of 16.8M anonymous online posts in the German-speaking area to learn continuous document representations of cities. These representations capture continuous regional linguistic distinctions, and can serve as input to downstream NLP tasks sensitive to regional variation. By incorporating geographic information via retrofitting and agglomerative clustering with structure, we recover dialect areas at various levels of granularity. Evaluating these clusters against an existing dialect map, we achieve a match of up to 0.77 V-score (harmonic mean of cluster completeness and homogeneity). Our results show that representation learning with retrofitting offers a robust general method to automatically expose dialectal differences and regional variation at a finer granularity than was previously possible.","tags":["computational sociolinguistics","sociolinguistics","NLP","representation learning","embeddings","retrofitting"],"title":"Capturing Regional Variation with Distributed Place Representations and Geographic Retrofitting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silviu Paun","Bob Carpenter","Jon Chamberlain","Dirk Hovy","Udo Kruschwitz","Massimo Poesio"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1540166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540166400,"objectID":"ac97468b9625b50fc42dc47858c6d8d2","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2018-comparing-bayesian-models-annotation/","publishdate":"2020-02-29T14:48:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-comparing-bayesian-models-annotation/","section":"publication","summary":"The analysis of crowdsourced annotations in natural language processing is concerned with identifying (1) gold standard labels, (2) annotator accuracies and biases, and (3) item difficulties and error patterns.
