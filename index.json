Most of the proposed automatic methods are conducted exclusively on English and very few consistently labeled, non-English resources have been proposed.

This work is the first to shed light on the limits of this zero-shot, cross-lingual transfer learning framework for hate speech detection. We use benchmark data sets in English, Italian, and Spanish to detect hate speech towards immigrants and women. Investigating post-hoc explanations of the model, we discover that non-hateful, language-specific taboo interjections are misinterpreted as signals of hate speech.

In this paper, we use election manifestos of Swedish and Indian political parties to learn neural models that distinguish actual pledges from generic political positions. Since pledges might vary by election year and party, we implement a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) setup, predicting election year and manifesto's party as auxiliary tasks. Pledges can also span several sentences, so we use hierarchical models that incorporate contextual information. Lastly, we evaluate the models in a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) framework across countries and languages.

Several NLP methods have been proposed to classify texts as truthful or deceptive. In most cases, however, the target texts’ preceding context is not considered. This is a severe limitation, as any communication takes place in context, not in a vacuum, and context can help to detect deception. We study a corpus of Italian dialogues containing deceptive statements and implement deep neural models that incorporate various linguistic contexts. We establish a new state-of-the-art identifying deception and find that not all context is equally useful to the task. Only the texts closest to the target, if from the same speaker (rather than questions by an interlocutor), boost performance. We also find that the semantic information in language models such as BERT contributes to the performance. However, BERT alone does not capture the implicit knowledge of deception cues: its contribution is conditional on the concurrent use of attention to learn cues from BERT’s representations.","tags":["deception detection","dataset","NLP"],"title":"BERTective: Language Models and Contextual Information for Deception Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Bianchi","Silvia Terragni","Dirk Hovy","Debora Nozza","Elisabetta Fersini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"b4e481bdc36e151c5f7c537366aa81d6","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2021-crosslingual-topic-model/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-crosslingual-topic-model/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a novel topic modeling method that can make use of contextulized embeddings (e.g., BERT) to do zero-shot cross-lingual topic modeling.","tags":["NLP","Topic Modeling","BERT","Language Models"],"title":"Cross-lingual Contextualized Topic Models with Zero-shot Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Hovy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"5cb6c78d7dfa74acb0b3dc3d0145145c","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2020_nlpss/","publishdate":"2020-02-29T14:48:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_nlpss/","section":"publication","summary":"Text is everywhere, and it is a fantastic resource for social scientists.

In particular, Devlin et al. (2019) proposed a model, called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which enables researchers to obtain state-of-the art performance on numerous NLP tasks by fine-tuning the representations on their data set and task, without the need for developing and training highly-specific architectures. The authors also released multilingual BERT (mBERT), a model trained on a corpus of 104 languages, which can serve as a universal language model. This model obtained impressive results on a zero-shot cross-lingual natural inference task. Driven by the potential of BERT models, the NLP community has started to investigate and generate an abundant number of BERT models that are trained on a particular language, and tested on a specific data domain and task. This allows us to evaluate the true potential of mBERT as a universal language model, by comparing it to the performance of these more specific models. This paper presents the current state of the art in language-specific BERT models, providing an overall picture with respect to different dimensions (i.e. architectures, data domains, and tasks). Our aim is to provide an immediate and straightforward overview of the commonalities and differences between Language-Specific (language-specific) BERT models and mBERT.

Current artificial intelligence-based language systems wouldn’t have a clue. “Natural language processing (NLP) technologies,” Prof. Hovy says, “fail to account for demographics both in understanding language and in generating it. And this failure prevents us from reaching human-like performance. It limits possible future applications and it introduces systematic bias against underrepresented demographic groups”.\n🗞️🗞️ Related articles featured in Corriere Innovazione and Bocconi News.\n ","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"d6b57eefc5eca031cd0bb3edb943a34f","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/project/integrator/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/integrator/","section":"project","summary":"Incorporating Demographic Factors into Natural Language Processing Models","tags":["demographic","NLP"],"title":"INTEGRATOR","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["computational social science","political science","nlp"],"content":"In this inter-disciplinary project, Dirk Hovy and Tommaso Fornaciari team up with an international team of political scientists (led bt the University of Gothenburg) to develop mixed methods for analyzing political parties’ promises to voters during election campaigns. For democracy to function effectively, political parties must offer clear choices to voters during election campaigns. However, as parties’ communication with voters has become increasingly fragmented and targeted, it is much harder for citizens to keep track of what parties are promising. This threatens the quality of democratic representation. It also challenges established research methods for studying parties’ campaign promises. This project will develop new methods for studying parties’ promises in modern election campaigns. The project will integrate existing qualitative methods in political science and develop new research tools based on NLP. These AI-powered tools will enable researchers to examine parties’ campaign promises in large amounts of text and speech. The resulting research will be of significant benefit to citizens, who will receive greater clarity on the choices that parties are offering. These existing and new methods are highly relevant to research on text and speech in a wide range of social science fields. Until now, progress in this field has been stifled by limited dialogue among the proponents of different qualitative and quantitative methods. The project includes established experts on parties’ campaign promises, new media, qualitative and quantitative methods for analyzing political texts, and machine learning and natural language processing.

This interdisciplinary, multi-institutional project (led by George Washington University) helps Twitter tackle these issues by developing metrics and algorithms to measure various uncivil behaviors. Given the concerns about growing polarization and the spread of misinformation, our first two metrics, mutual recognition and diversity of perspectives, will help Twitter diagnose issues that arise when users isolate themselves from those who hold differing opinions. Mutual recognition measures whether and to what extent people on opposing sides of an issue acknowledge and engage with rival claims. When recognition occurs, a public sphere is established. When there is no recognition, echo chambers result. Diversity of perspectives measures the range of claims made on the platform, how likely users are to encounter (as opposed to engaging with) divergent and unfamiliar claims, and how polarized the debate is.\nOur second two metrics, incivility, and intolerance, will help Twitter identify and address abuse and targeted harassment. Incivility measures the presence of anti-normative intensity in conversation, including the use of profanity and vulgarity. However, recognizing that such anti-normative communication sometimes serves justifiable\u0026ndash;and in some cases, even beneficial\u0026ndash;ends, we distinguish this concept from intolerance. Targeted attacks on individuals or groups, particularly when carried out based on gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, or ability, threaten the fundamental democratic principles of equality and freedom.\nTo classify these measures at scale, we draw upon existing work in various computational fields, notably natural language processing and network analysis, but take this work further in addressing the metrics outlined here. Moreover, beyond merely detecting and measuring mutual recognition, diversity of perspectives, incivility, and intolerance, we propose to study the effects these four phenomena have on users. In doing so, we offer a theoretically and empirically driven approach that will help Twitter diagnose the conversation\u0026rsquo;s relative health on its platform.\n","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"b687a82907bfa3278ec0305ce0470f43","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/project/twitterhealth/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/twitterhealth/","section":"project","summary":"Devising Metrics for Assessing Echo Chambers, Incivility, and Intolerance on Twitter","tags":["social media","political science","nlp"],"title":"Twitter Healthy Conversations","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alexandra Uma","Tommaso Fornaciari","Dirk Hovy","Silviu Paun","Barbara Plank","Massimo Poesio"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"a5fe34b8d82f43aca4cded8dbebd251c","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2020_aaai_softlabels/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_aaai_softlabels/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, Peterson et al. provided evidence of the benefits of using probabilistic soft labels generated from crowd annotations for training a computer vision model, showing that using such labels maximizes performance of the models over unseen data.

Models trained this way are generally successful at discriminating between ‘genuine’ online reviews and the crowdsourced deceptive reviews. It has been argued that the deceptive reviews obtained via crowdsourcing are very different from real fake reviews, but the claim has never been properly tested. In this paper, we compare (false) crowdsourced reviews with a set of ‘real’ fake reviews published on line. We evaluate their degree of similarity and their usefulness in training models for the detection of untrustworthy reviews.

While effective, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, since networks are usually represented as sparse adjacency matrices of connections, which grow exponentially with the number of users. In order to incorporate this information, we therefore need to limit the network size, in turn limiting performance and risking sample bias. In this paper, we address these limitations by instead using dense network representations. We explore two methods to learn continuous node representations from either 1) the network structure with node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016), or 2) textual user mentions via doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014). We combine both methods with input from social media posts in an attention-based convolutional neural network and evaluate the contribution of each component on geolocation performance. Our method enables us to incorporate arbitrarily large networks in a fixed-length vector, without limiting the network size. Our models achieve competitive results with similar state-of-the-art methods, but with much fewer model parameters, while being applicable to networks of virtually any size.

Typically, the problem is modeled as either multi-class classification or regression. In the first case, the classes are geographic areas previously identified; in the second, the models directly predict geographic coordinates. The former requires discretization of the coordinates, but yields better performance. The latter is potentially more precise and true to the nature of the problem, but often results in worse performance. We propose to combine the two approaches in an attention-based multitask convolutional neural network that jointly predicts both discrete locations and continuous geographic coordinates. We evaluate the multi-task (MTL) model against single-task models and prior work. We find that MTL significantly improves performance, reporting large gains on one data set, but also note that the correlation between labels and coordinates has a marked impact on the effectiveness of including a regression task.","tags":["geolocation","multitask learning","NLP"],"title":"Geolocation with Attention-Based Multitask Learning Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanh Nguyen","Dirk Hovy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572739200,"objectID":"da268d55d2d3daa3188db963df72f794","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2019_siri/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T01:35:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_siri/","section":"publication","summary":"User reviews provide a significant source of information for companies to understand their market and audience.

However, locations are usually given as continuous latitude/longitude tuples, so we first need to define discrete geographic regions that can serve as labels. Most studies use some form of clustering to discretize the continuous coordinates (Han et al., 2016). However, the resulting regions do not always correspond to existing linguistic areas. Consequently, accuracy at 100 miles tends to be good, but degrades for finer-grained distinctions, when different linguistic regions get lumped together. We describe a new algorithm, Point-to-City (P2C), an iterative k-d tree-based method for clustering geographic coordinates and associating them with towns. We create three sets of labels at different levels of granularity, and compare performance of a state-of-the-art geolocation model trained and tested with P2C labels to one with regular k-d tree labels. Even though P2C results in substantially more labels than the baseline, model accuracy increases significantly over using traditional labels at the fine-grained level, while staying comparable at 100 miles. The results suggest that identifying meaningful linguistic areas is crucial for improving geolocation at a fine-grained level.","tags":["geolocation","NLP","clustering"],"title":"Identifying Linguistic Areas for Geolocation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aparna Garimella","Carmen Banea","Dirk Hovy","Rada Mihalcea"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562112000,"objectID":"5dec16fd019afc36d15e76cab7ab6ea4","permalink":"https://milanlproc.github.io/publication/2019-gender-bias-part-of-speech-tagging-dependency-parsing/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T01:35:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-gender-bias-part-of-speech-tagging-dependency-parsing/","section":"publication","summary":"Several linguistic studies have shown the prevalence of various lexical and grammatical patterns in texts authored by a person of a particular gender, but models for part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing have still not adapted to account for these differences.

We use Doc2Vec on a corpus of 16.8M anonymous online posts in the German-speaking area to learn continuous document representations of cities. These representations capture continuous regional linguistic distinctions, and can serve as input to downstream NLP tasks sensitive to regional variation. By incorporating geographic information via retrofitting and agglomerative clustering with structure, we recover dialect areas at various levels of granularity. Evaluating these clusters against an existing dialect map, we achieve a match of up to 0.77 V-score (harmonic mean of cluster completeness and homogeneity).
