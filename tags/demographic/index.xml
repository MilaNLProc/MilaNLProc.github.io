      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, discontent in democracy, mistrust in institutions, and the rise of populist parties have strained European societies. Underlying these tensions are often increasing inequalities in Western countries, which fuel the discontent of individuals. The Covid pandemic further exacerbated these problems, as anti-Covid measures taken by governments differently impacted societal groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MENTALISM project combines modern social media analysis with traditional survey data to track inequality across Italy through the lens of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ground-breaking mixed-methods approach uses machine learning and text analysis to trace online grievances in a vast corpus of social media data. We combine these methods with survey protocols and econometric analysis to validate the findings and provide actionable policy advice. MENTALISM combines the advantages of social media data (high-frequency, individual-level information) with the strength of socio-economic surveys (representativeness). Our novel interdisciplinary approach will critically evaluate the value of social media monitoring for policy feedback. Moreover, it will establish protocols for policymakers to better respond to growing grievances brought on by inequality at various steps in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interdisciplinary project is led by Profs. Carlo Schwarz (economics), and Dirk Hovy (NLP).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dirk Hovy, scientific director of DMI and Associate Professor of computer science, has won an &lt;strong&gt;ERC starting grant of 1.5mln euros&lt;/strong&gt;. His project &lt;strong&gt;introduces demographic factors into language processing systems&lt;/strong&gt;, which will improve algorithmic performance, avoid racism, sexism, and ageism, and open up new applications.
What if I wrote that ‚Äúwinning an ERC Grant, Dirk Hovy got a sick result?‚Äù. Those familiar with the use of ‚Äúsick‚Äù as a synonym for ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúawesome‚Äù among teenagers would think that Bocconi Knowledge hired a very young writer (or someone posing as such). The rest would think I went crazy. Current artificial intelligence-based language systems wouldn‚Äôt have a clue. ‚ÄúNatural language processing (NLP) technologies,‚Äù Prof. Hovy says, ‚Äúfail to account for demographics both in understanding language and in generating it. And this failure prevents us from reaching human-like performance. It limits possible future applications and it introduces systematic bias against underrepresented demographic groups‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
